What It’s About
Our project is a web app that replays the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final (France vs. Argentina). It helps soccer players and coaches see their mistakes and get tips to play better. The field updates every 2 seconds, showing players moving based on real match data. Click a player (like Messi) to see their stats and advice—like where to move to score. The advice uses a math trick to pick the best spot and looks at the player’s position, goals, and team performance (xG balance).
Tools and Libraries Used
•	Dash: Makes the web app.
•	Plotly: Draws the field and players.
•	StatsBombPy: Gets match data from StatsBomb.
•	Pandas: Organizes the match data.
•	NumPy: Does math for distances and angles.
•	Scikit-learn: Helps pick the best spot to move with a math trick (logistic regression).
•	Random: Makes players move a bit randomly.
Important Things to Know
•	The app updates every 5 seconds (we changed it from 2 seconds to avoid crashes).
•	Player stats (like goals) are made up for this demo—they’re not real.
•	The app runs in a browser—no need to install anything extra.
•	It helps players and coaches learn from mistakes, like seeing if a defender was too far away, and gives tips to improve, like moving closer to the goal.
